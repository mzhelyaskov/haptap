[ ] Create ADR for contract interfaces, DTOs, Entities and frontend api layer interfaces naming. Take into account
    contraversions like UserEntity vs User. UserRequest vs User and so on. Do we need such suffixes?
[ ] Improve approach for ConfigModule. I don't think to keep all config in the env properties. Probably would be better
    to keep config in the TypeScript files.
